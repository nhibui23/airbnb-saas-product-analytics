# Airbnb NYC Project

## Business Questions
**You're a Product Analyst at Airbnb. The growth team has one question:**
**Where should we invest next, and what should a new host in that market do to succeed?**

To answer it, I analyzed 64,038 NYC listings across 5 boroughs to identify:
1. What host factors actually drive review ratings
2. Whether the Instant Book feature moves the needle on engagement
3. Which neighborhoods represent the biggest untapped growth opportunity

The result is a data-backed growth playbook for Airbnb on where to expand, what to build, 
and which features to prioritize.

## Results at a Glance
- **Availability** is the #1 driver of review ratings (ANOVA p < 0.0001)
- **Instant Bookable** has no measurable impact on engagement (p = 0.38)
- **The Bronx** is the clearest growth opportunity with the highest ratings and lowest supply

## Motivation
As a frequent traveler between Villanova and New York City, I have always been curious about what separates a great Airbnb listing from a mediocre one. Pricing seems inconsistent, quality varies widely, and some neighbourhoods clearly outperform others. This project therefore takes a data-driven approach to understand what actually drives listing success on the Airbnb platform.

## Dataset
[Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arianazmoudeh/airbnbopendata) with 102,599 NYC listings, cleaned down to 64,038 rows across 21 columns.

## Tools Used
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, statsmodels): analysis & statistical testing
- **PostgreSQL** : market segmentation & deep-dive queries
- **Power BI**: executive dashboard
- **Claude API**: AI-powered insight layer

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed dollar signs from price columns, dropped inactive listings with no reviews, handled outliers including negative minimum nights and availability exceeding 365 days
- **EDA:** Explored initial distributions and group comparisons using histograms, bar charts, box plots, and correlation heatmaps
- **A/B Testing:** Welch's t-test comparing instant bookable vs non-instant bookable listings, which was later validated with Cohen's d effect size, post-hoc power analysis, 95% confidence intervals, and KDE distribution plots.
- **Statistical Testing:** ANOVA with Tukey's HSD post-hoc correction for multi-group comparisons, which contrasted with my findings in EDA.

## Limitations
- Snapshot data only
- No actual booking or revenue data
- Review ratings are small groups (1–5)
- All findings are correlational, not causal 
- Results are specific to NYC and may not generalize to other markets
- No revenue metrics

## Key Findings

**Factors that significantly impact ratings:**
- Availability is the strongest predictor (ANOVA p < 0.0001, 3 significant pairs in Tukey's HSD) 
- Monthly stays (8–30 nights) significantly outperform short and medium stays (p = 0.0001)
- Very high priced listings ($1000+) rate significantly lower than mid-range listings (p = 0.0004)

**Factors that do not matter:**
- Instant Book shows no significant impact on engagement (Welch's t-test p = 0.38, Cohen's d = 0.007, power = 14.3%), as all 4 validation methods confirm this.
- Host identity verification has nearly no effect on ratings (p = 0.62).

**Growth opportunity:**
- The Bronx has the highest average rating (3.36), strong review activity (1.85/month), and the lowest listing supply among major boroughs (2,049)
- Mott Haven, Schuylerville, and Belmont are the top 3 neighbourhoods for targeted host acquisition.

## Product Recommendations
1. Develop a **pricing guidance tool** to help hosts avoid overpricing relative to their listing quality
2. **Promote monthly stays** as a premium tier with dedicated host badges and guest discounts
3. Encourage hosts to **schedule maintenance breaks** rather than listing year-round
4. Focus **host acquisition efforts in the Bronx**, specifically Mott Haven, Schuylerville, and Belmont
5. Shift **resources away from Instant Book** as a growth lever

## Future data needed
- **Booking volume data** to measure actual demand
- **Time-series data** to validate whether recommendations improve outcomes
- **Listing photo and description quality** for potential maintenance suggestions
- **Guest demographics** to understand rating behavior across traveler types
- **Competitor pricing data** to build the recommended pricing tool
